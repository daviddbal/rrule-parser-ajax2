# rrule-parser-simple-jsp-ajax

A iCalendar RRULE parser using a simple Java servlet, JSP and JavaScript using AJAX.  The AJAX code allows the server response to be displayed on the same page without a refresh (Asynchronous data transer).

This version includes some styling and extra controls to build a RRULE instead of requiring the user to type it.

See RFC 5545 for more info about iCalendar.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545

Uses iCalendarFx from jfxtras.org to parse the RRULE.
